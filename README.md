### :book: About me
I'm a self-taught *(kinda)*, JavaScript developer, Started coding around **March 2020** because of the covid-19 lockdown, I went first into coding Discord bots *without any JS skill (:* and fell in love from the first lines of code, I started being far more active in coding by the end of 2021, I moved to UX/UI as my main sector in 2021. I then moved to HTML/SCSS/JS around May 2021 which is what I use daily now. I also started looking more into C#, I took part of [Injaz El-Djazair](https://www.injaz-eldjazair.org/) 2020  edition as a lead front-end developer, I also was on top of [Vanilla Remastered's](https://vanilla-remastered.com) development team for 6 months and managed the community for more than 2 years. Currently, I am contributing to [The Arab Future](https://github.com/The-Arab-Future) as a User Experience consultant and junior front-end developer, and yeah I guess that's me, mayo. (⌐■_■)
