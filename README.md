### :book: About me

I am a self-taught *(kinda)* Javescript developer. I started coding roughly around **March of 2020** because of the covid-19 lockdown. I began development with Discord bots without any past knowledge of JS. I fell in love with it starting with the first few lines. I got more into development in the beginning of **2021** and then moved into UX/UI, HTML, SCSS, and JS. I also began learning C# and even took part of a project named [Injaz El-Djazair](https://www.injaz-eldjazair.org/) 2020 Edition as the primary lead developer. I also was the primary developer of [Vanilla Remastered's](https://vanilla-remastered.com) for six months and even managed the community for more than two years. I am currently contributing to  [The Arab Future](https://github.com/The-Arab-Future)  as an User Experience consultant and as a front-end developer. But uh yeah, that's me, Mayo.  (⌐■_■)
